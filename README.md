# adventOfCode

A list of all my solutions to advent of code through the years. The first year I completed all of the problems was 2022. I am working on building my solution bank for the years prior.

## Current Progress

I am attempted to complete the problems for 2019 through the days of November 2023 before the actual 2023 event.

## Helper code used

I use the advent-of-code-data library that is on pip. I have also made myself some helper functions, these are `startDay.py` and `copier.py`. `startDay.py` gets the data from the website and creates an `input.txt` file for me to get the data and a pre-written starter piece of code that allows me to both test and submit my code. `copier.py` allows me to streamline the writing of my solution to the second part, whilst keeping my part 1 solution. It copies all the important sections of code from my first solution whilst removing the parts no longer necessary.
